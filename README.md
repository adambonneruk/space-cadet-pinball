# Space Cadet Pinball (Installer)

## Introduction
As a software developer I've written lots of code before but I wanted to tackle an interesting problem: _"how do I get pinball onto a relatives PC without giving them complex instructions?"_ and thus the idea of writing an installer was born.

### Project Aims, Features and Background
- Single ```.exe``` to install 3D Pinball for Windows â€“ Space Cadet on a modern (Windows 10/11) PC
- K4zmu2a modern SDL-based decompilation executables for both x86 and x86-64 platforms
- Start Menu, Desktop Shortcut, Add/Remove Programs, and an Uninstaller

### Prerequisites & Build Instructions

```powershell
# Build Installer
makensis '.\installer\space-cadet-pinball-installer.nsi'
```
